# Udacity-Capstone-Project-Sparkify_PredictUserChurn
# Project Overview:
This is a Udacity nanodegree project (Data Science Capstone). This project uses users’ event data from Sparkify to build a model to predict users’ churn.
The original dataset is 12GB but a small subset of the dataset (128MB) will be used in this notebook.
